Midi Messages
* See what happens to (@time and @delta) when two notes are played at the same time
  - Also what happens when one note starts, then another starts and stops before the first finishes

Stored Midi Format
* CSV Output of something like ev.inspect or a custom ev.to_s


Object Model
* Building has layers...

SCAD
* Consider using different patterns instead of only windows
* Buildings could have layers determined by the number of octaves of its note there was played
  - Layer height could be buidling height divided by number of layers
  - Layer width could be a feature of the music
  - Layer might have many rows of windows or just one set of tall windows


TODO
  * Need to redo layout of windows inside a layer (too much space at the bottom of the layer)


IDEA:
  * Make difference and union functions which take blocks that wrap the block in union or difference
